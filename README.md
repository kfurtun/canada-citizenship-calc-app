# Canadian Citizenship Eligibility Calculator

## Introduction

This is a mobile app that allows users to calculate their eligibility date towards applying Canadian citizenship. This app gets user's history about their study, work and travel period as well as PR date to determine the earliest application date for Canadian citizenship.
